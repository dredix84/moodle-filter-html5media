# moodle-filter-html5media
A Moodle filter which encodes media files supported by HTML 5 to the HTML 5 standard of embedding media content.

## Introduction
This filter will search for all links which are supported HTML 5 media types in the href and transform them to make playable within the browser without the use a flash or an external player. This makes Moodle more HTML 5 compliant and mobile friendly. A basic example of what this plugin does can been seen below.

You include a link to a video file as follows:
```
<a href="http://www.yourmoodlesite.com/media/movie.mp4">
```
The plugin will transform the url above into what is seen below.
```
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
	<source src="http://www.yourmoodlesite.com/media/movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video> 
```

This plugin is not in any way to compete with the multimedia plugin which is part of the baseline code of Moodle but rather a filter which makes media files in Moodle more HTML 5 compliant. What does this mean? All devices will be able to play the media files with the browserâ€™s built in media playback functionality so there is no need for third party tools like flash
